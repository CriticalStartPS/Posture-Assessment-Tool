- `config/ConditionalAccess/policy_requirements.yaml`

### Authorization Policies  
- `config/AuthorizationPolicy/policy_requirements.yaml`

### Defender for Office 365 Policies

#### Anti-Spam Policies
- `config/DefenderForOffice365/antispam_inbound_standard_requirements.yaml` - Standard protection
- `config/DefenderForOffice365/antispam_inbound_strict_requirements.yaml` - Strict protection  
- `config/DefenderForOffice365/antispam_outbound_requirements.yaml` - Outbound controls

#### Anti-Phishing Policies
- `config/DefenderForOffice365/antiphishing_standard_requirements.yaml` - Standard protection
- `config/DefenderForOffice365/antiphishing_strict_requirements.yaml` - Strict protection

#### Anti-Malware Policies

- Secure token caching to avoid repeated authentication
- Interactive Exchange Online authentication for anti-spam checks

### 2. **Policy Assessment**
- **Conditional Access**: Retrieves all CA policies and matches against requirements
- **Authorization**: Evaluates tenant-level authorization settings
- **Defender for Office 365**: Uses shared session management to efficiently assess:
  - **Anti-Spam**: Connects to Exchange Online to assess inbound/outbound filtering
  - **Anti-Phishing**: Evaluates spoofing protection and impersonation detection
  - **Anti-Malware**: Checks file filtering, ZAP settings, and quarantine policies
- **Defender for Endpoint**: Uses Microsoft Graph API to assess Intune configurations:
  - **Antivirus**: Evaluates Defender antivirus protection settings and policies
  - **Attack Surface Reduction**: Checks ASR rules and malicious behavior blocking

### 3. **Compliance Evaluation**
- Checks each policy against defined security baselines
- Supports multiple protection levels (Standard vs Strict)
- Provides detailed per-policy compliance status
- **Special Logic**:
  - **Anti-Malware FileTypes**: Case-insensitive array comparison ensuring all dangerous file types are blocked
  - **Anti-Phishing**: Advanced spoofing and impersonation detection checks
  - **Defender for Endpoint**: Direct compliance evaluation using `is_compliant` field from Intune configurations
  - **Policy-Level Compliance**: Requirements met when at least one policy satisfies all criteria

### 4. **Report Generation**

## ü§ù Contributing

This tool is designed to be extensible. To add new policy types:
1. Create appropriate handler class (following existing patterns)
2. Add YAML configuration file with requirements
3. Update main.py integration and ExchangeOnlineSessionManager if needed
4. Enhance report template for new policy display
5. Update README.md documentation

### Handler Architecture
All handlers follow a consistent pattern:
- **Defender for Office 365 handlers**: Accept requirements file and shared ExchangeOnlineSessionManager
- **Defender for Endpoint handlers**: Accept requirements file and Microsoft Graph token for Intune API access
- **check_policies()**: Main method returning standardized result format with `is_compliant` field
- **_check_policy_requirements()**: Internal compliance evaluation logic
- **Integration**: Seamless integration with respective session managers and APIs
