## üìã Requirements

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- Microsoft 365 tenant with appropriate permissions
- Exchange Online PowerShell module (for anti-spam checks)

### Required Permissions
- **Microsoft Graph**: 
  - `Policy.Read.All` (Conditional Access)
  - `Policy.ReadWrite.AuthorizationPolicy` (Authorization Policies)
- **Exchange Online**: 
  - Exchange Administrator or Global Administrator role
  - Required for anti-spam, anti-phishing, and anti-malware policy checks

### Python Dependencies
Install required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Exchange Online Module
For Defender for Office 365 policy checking (anti-spam, anti-phishing, anti-malware), install the Exchange Online Management module:
```powershell
Install-Module -Name ExchangeOnlineManagement -Force
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Files

The tool uses YAML configuration files to define security requirements:

### Conditional Access
- `config/ConditionalAccess/policy_requirements.yaml`

### Authorization Policies  
- `config/AuthorizationPolicy/policy_requirements.yaml`

### Defender for Office 365 Policies

#### Anti-Spam Policies
- `config/DefenderForOffice365/antispam_inbound_standard_requirements.yaml` - Standard protection
- `config/DefenderForOffice365/antispam_inbound_strict_requirements.yaml` - Strict protection  
- `config/DefenderForOffice365/antispam_outbound_requirements.yaml` - Outbound controls

#### Anti-Phishing Policies
- `config/DefenderForOffice365/antiphishing_standard_requirements.yaml` - Standard protection
- `config/DefenderForOffice365/antiphishing_strict_requirements.yaml` - Strict protection

#### Anti-Malware Policies
- `config/DefenderForOffice365/antimalware_requirements.yaml` - Malware protection settings

## üöÄ How It Works

### 1. **Authentication Flow**
- Device code authentication with Microsoft Graph
- Secure token caching to avoid repeated authentication
- Interactive Exchange Online authentication for anti-spam checks

### 2. **Policy Assessment**
- **Conditional Access**: Retrieves all CA policies and matches against requirements
- **Authorization**: Evaluates tenant-level authorization settings
- **Defender for Office 365**: Uses shared session management to efficiently assess:
  - **Anti-Spam**: Connects to Exchange Online to assess inbound/outbound filtering
  - **Anti-Phishing**: Evaluates spoofing protection and impersonation detection
  - **Anti-Malware**: Checks file filtering, ZAP settings, and quarantine policies

### 3. **Compliance Evaluation**
- Checks each policy against defined security baselines
- Supports multiple protection levels (Standard vs Strict)
- Provides detailed per-policy compliance status
- **Special Logic**:
  - **Anti-Malware FileTypes**: Case-insensitive array comparison ensuring all dangerous file types are blocked
  - **Anti-Phishing**: Advanced spoofing and impersonation detection checks
  - **Policy-Level Compliance**: Requirements met when at least one policy satisfies all criteria

### 4. **Report Generation**
- Creates comprehensive HTML reports with visual indicators
- Organizes results by policy type and protection level
- Includes executive summary with overall compliance metrics
- **Enhanced Sections**:
  - Anti-Spam (Inbound Standard, Inbound Strict, Outbound)
  - Anti-Phishing (Standard, Strict)
  - Anti-Malware (File filtering, ZAP, Quarantine)

## üìä Protection Levels

### Standard Protection (üìã)
- **Target**: Most organizations with balanced security needs
- **Approach**: Moderate filtering, user-friendly actions
- **Example**: Bulk email threshold of 7, move spam to Junk folder

### Strict Protection (üîí)  
- **Target**: High-security environments, sensitive industries
- **Approach**: Aggressive filtering, strict actions
- **Example**: Bulk email threshold of 4, quarantine/delete threats
