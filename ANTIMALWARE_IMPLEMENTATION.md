# Anti-Malware Policy Handler Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully created an `AntiMalwarePolicyHandler` class for Defender for Office 365, following the established pattern of other policy handlers in the system.

## Files Created/Modified

### 1. Created: `config/DefenderForOffice365/antimalware_requirements.yaml`
- Configuration-focused requirements file based on the provided anti-malware policy JSON
- Includes 8 key requirements:
  - File Filter Enabled (EnableFileFilter: true)
  - File Type Action - Quarantine (FileTypeAction: "Quarantine")
  - Comprehensive File Types Blocked (FileTypes: extensive list of dangerous file types)
  - ZAP Enabled (ZapEnabled: true)
  - Custom Notifications Disabled (CustomNotifications: false)
  - External Sender Admin Notifications Disabled (EnableExternalSenderAdminNotifications: false)  
  - Internal Sender Admin Notifications Disabled (EnableInternalSenderAdminNotifications: false)
  - Quarantine Tag Set (QuarantineTag: "AdminOnlyAccessPolicy")

### 2. Created: `DefenderForOffice365/AntiMalwarePolicyHandler.py`
- Follows same pattern as AntiSpamPolicyHandler and AntiPhishingPolicyHandler
- Uses shared ExchangeOnlineSessionManager for single-session operations
- Implements compliance checking logic for boolean, string, and array (FileTypes) values
- Special handling for FileTypes array to check if all expected file types are present
- Provides detailed policy results and compliance reporting

### 3. Modified: `DefenderForOffice365/ExchangeOnlineSessionManager.py`
- Added support for 'antimalware' policy type
- Updated default policy types to include antimalware
- Added PowerShell script section for retrieving anti-malware policies using `Get-MalwareFilterPolicy`
- Added parsing logic for ANTIMALWARE_DATA_START/END markers
- Updated documentation to reflect new policy type support

### 4. Modified: `main.py`
- Added import for AntiMalwarePolicyHandler
- Added antimalware_results initialization
- Added logic to check for antimalware_requirements.yaml file
- Added antimalware to defender_policy_types when requirements file exists
- Added antimalware policy processing with error handling
- Updated error handling to include antimalware_results
- Updated report generation call to include antimalware_results

### 5. Modified: `ReportGenerator.py`
- Updated generate_report() method signature to accept antimalware_results parameter
- Added antimalware_compliance calculation using existing compliance logic
- Updated overall compliance calculation to include antimalware results
- Added antimalware_compliance to template rendering context

### 6. Modified: `templates/report_template.html`
- Updated overall compliance calculation to include antimalware results (with null check)
- Added anti-malware compliance indicator in executive summary
- Added detailed anti-malware policy section with:
  - Policy compliance status display
  - Expected value formatting (handles arrays like FileTypes)
  - Individual policy result breakdown
  - Visual indicators for compliant/non-compliant status

## Key Features

### Single Session Management
- Uses the shared ExchangeOnlineSessionManager to retrieve all Defender policies in one authentication session
- Reduces authentication overhead and improves performance

### Comprehensive File Type Checking
- Special logic for FileTypes array comparison (case-insensitive)
- Checks that all expected dangerous file types are present in current policy
- Handles the extensive list of file extensions from the provided configuration

### Flexible Compliance Logic
- Boolean settings: exact match required
- String settings: exact match required  
- Array settings (FileTypes): all expected values must be present
- Detailed policy-by-policy reporting

### Error Handling
- Graceful handling of missing Exchange Online module
- Connection error handling
- Exception handling with meaningful error messages
- Fallback to empty results when needed

### Reporting Integration
- Full integration with existing HTML report template
- Executive summary shows anti-malware compliance
- Detailed policy section shows individual requirement status
- Visual indicators for compliance status

## Usage
The anti-malware policy handler is automatically used when the `antimalware_requirements.yaml` file is present. It will:

1. Load requirements from the YAML file
2. Use the shared Exchange Online session to retrieve anti-malware policies
3. Check each requirement against all enabled policies
4. Generate detailed compliance results
5. Include results in the final HTML report

## Validation
- All Python files compile without syntax errors
- YAML file has valid syntax
- AntiMalwarePolicyHandler can be imported and instantiated successfully
- ExchangeOnlineSessionManager supports the new 'antimalware' policy type
- Requirements are loaded properly from the YAML file

The implementation is ready for use and follows all established patterns in the codebase.
